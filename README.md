## Getting Started (Setup Instructions)

To run the project locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace <repository-url> with the GitHub repository URL.

### Setup Frontend

Navigate to the client folder.

```bash
cd client
```

Install client dependencies for the React/Next.js frontend.

```bash
npm install
```

### Setup Backend

Navigate to the server folder.  
Return to the root directory and navigate to the server folder.

```bash
cd ../server
```

Install server dependencies.  
Install the required `Node.js` and `Express.js` packages.

```bash
npm install mongoose nodemon
```

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the server folder with the following keys:

```bash
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret-key>
PORT=5000
```

Replace <your-mongodb-connection-string> with the URL of your MongoDB database. Also, replace <jwt-secret-key>.

### Run Application

Start the client side.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start the server side.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the back-end server with **nodemon** for auto-restart during development.

### Access the Application

- Frontend: The React.js/Next.js app will typically be available at http://localhost:3000.
- Backend: The Express.js server will run on http://localhost:5000 or the port specified in your .env file.
